# Senior-Seminar

At the moment, I am stuck on what syntax I need to complete the project. I have the data loading, storing the students in an array list, creating a 2d array which stores the corresponding array list (for the session) in the cell and there should ideally be all the people in the session in the array list and in turn in the cell. 

Although I feel stuck where I am, I wanted to outline my thought process and what I hope would be the process and function of my program:
- I hope that I can manually adjust the numbers displayed in the array list where it goes past 18 and replace those with the sessions that need to be repeated/moved around because of conflicts. The program would also itterate through the 2d array and in each cell use a for:each loop for the studenList (array list of all student) and if their 1st/2nd/etc choice matches that cell it adds them to either the cell or the array list directly. 

This is part of what I was unfortunately not able to accomplish but had envisioned, thank you!
